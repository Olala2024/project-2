## Project Description

The Ukraine Quiz is an engaging web application designed to test and expand your knowledge about Ukraine. The quiz presents a series of questions, each with multiple-choice answers. Users can track their score and receive feedback based on their performance.

## UX

![color pallette ](assets/images/color%20pallette.png)
The design of the Ukraine Quiz website features colors reminiscent of the Ukrainian flag. The color palette was created using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). The goal of the project is to offer a fun and educational quiz for individuals interested in learning about Ukraine or testing their existing knowledge. The quiz form's design is straightforward and user-friendly, based on sketches made in a notebook rather than detailed wireframes.
